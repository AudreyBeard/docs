W&B uses a W&B-managed cloud-native key to encrypt the W&B-managed database and object storage in every [Dedicated cloud]({{< relref "/guides/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud.md" >}}), by using the customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) capability in each cloud. In this case, W&B acts as a `customer` of the cloud provider, while providing the W&B platform as a service to you. Using a W&B-managed key means that W&B has control over the keys that it uses to encrypt the data in each cloud, thus doubling down on its promise to provide a highly safe and secure platform to all of its customers.

W&B uses a `unique key` to encrypt the data in each customer instance, providing another layer of isolation between Dedicated cloud tenants. The capability is available on AWS, Azure and GCP.

Dedicated cloud instances on GCP and Azure that W&B provisioned before August 2024 use the default cloud provider managed key for encrypting the W&B-managed database and object storage. Only new instances that W&B has been creating starting August 2024 use the W&B-managed cloud-native key for the relevant encryption.

Dedicated cloud instances on AWS have been using the W&B-managed cloud-native key for encryption from before August 2024.

W&B doesn't generally allow customers to bring their own cloud-native key to encrypt the W&B-managed database and object storage in their Dedicated cloud instance, because multiple teams and personas in an organization could have access to its cloud infrastructure for various reasons. Some of those teams or personas may not have context on W&B as a critical component in the organization's technology stack, and thus may remove the cloud-native key completely or revoke W&B's access to it. Such an action could corrupt all data in the organization's W&B instance and thus leave it in a irrecoverable state.

If your organization needs to use their own cloud-native key to encrypt the W&B-managed database and object storage to approve the use of Dedicated cloud for your AI workflows, W&B can review it on a exception basis. If approved, use of your cloud-native key for encryption would conform to the `shared responsibility model` of W&B Dedicated cloud. If any user in your organization removes your key or revokes W&B's access to it at any point when your Dedicated cloud instance is live, W&B would not be liable for any resulting data loss or corruption and also would not be responsible for recovery of such data.
