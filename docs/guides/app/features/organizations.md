## Change the account settings for an organization

If you're a paid user, then you can go to your 'Subscriptions' page and click on the three dots next to the 'Account' next to your organization name. You'll be then able to edit the billing info for your organization, add seats to your org or contact sales to upgrade your plan.

Similarly, if your organization is still on trial then you can go to your 'Subscriptions' page and click on the three dots next to the 'Account' to update your account settings. Then, you'll be able to add seats to your org, contact sales to upgrade your plan, etc.
