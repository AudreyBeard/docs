# Weave

To learn how to write your own queries interactively, **check out [this report](https://wandb.ai/luis_team_test/weave_example_queries/reports/Weave-queries---Vmlldzo1NzIxOTY2?accessToken=bvzq5hwooare9zy790yfl3oitutbvno2i6c2s81gk91750m53m2hdclj0jvryhcr)**, which goes from the basic operations available in Weave to other advanced visualizations of your data.

## Introduction

Weave Panels allow users to directly query W&B for data, visualize the results, and further analyze interactively. Adding Weave Panels is really easy:
* In your **Workspace**, click on `Add Panel` and select `Weave`.

* In a **Report**:
  * Type `/weave`and select `Weave` to add an independent Weave Panel.

  * Type `/Panel grid` -> `Panel grid` and then click on `Add panel` -> `Weave` to add a Weave Panel associated with a set of runs.

## Components

### Weave Expression

Weave Expressions allow the user to query the data stored in W&B - from runs, to artifacts, to models, to tables, and more! The most common Weave Expression is generated from logging a Table,`wandb.log({"cifar10_sample_table":<MY_TABLE>})`, and will look like this:

Let's break this down:

* `runs` is a **variable** automatically injected in Weave Panel Expressions when the Weave Panel is in a Workspace. Its "value" is the list of runs which are visible for that particular Workspace. [Read about the different attributes available within a run here](../../../../track/public-api-guide.md#understanding-the-different-attributes).
* `summary` is an **op** which returns the Summary object for a Run. Note: **ops** are "mapped", meaning this **op** is applied to each Run in the list, resulting in a list of Summary objects.
* `["cifar10_sample_table"]` is a Pick **op** (denoted with brackets), with a **parameter** of "predictions". Since Summary objects act like dictionaries or maps, this operation "picks" the "predictions" field off of each Summary object. As noted above, the "predictions" field is a Table, and therefore this query results in the Table above.

### Weave Configuration

Click on the gear icon on the upper left corner of the panel to expand the Weave Configuration. This allows the user to configure the type of panel and the parameters for the result panel.

### Weave Result Panel

Finally, the Weave Result Panel renders the result of the Weave Expression, using the selected Weave Panel, configured by the configuration to display the data in an interactive form. Here we can see a Table and a Plot of the same data.

## Basic Operations

### Sort
You can easily sort from the column options

### Filter
You can either filter directly in the query (first image) or using the filter button â–¼ in the top left corner (second image)

### Map
Map operation just iterates over data and applies a function. This can be done both directly from the Weave query (first image) or by inserting a new column from the column options (second gif)
