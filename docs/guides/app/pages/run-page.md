  Each training run of your model gets a dedicated page, organized within the
  larger project

# Run Page
Use the run page to explore detailed information about a specific run within a project.

## Overview tab
Use the Overview tab learn about a specific run in a project, such as:

* **Name**: The name of the run.
* **Description**:
* **Author**: The W&B entity that created the run.
* **State**: The [state of the run](#run-states).
* **Start time**: The timestamp when the queue was created.
* **Duration**: How long it took for the run to reach a state.
* **Run path**:
* **OS**: Operating system that completed the run.
* **Python version**: The Python version that created the run.
* **Git repository**: 
* **Command**: and command that launched the run 
* **System hardware**:
* **Config**: List of config parameters saved with [`wandb.config`](../../../guides/track/config.md)
* **Summary**: List of summary parameters saved with [`wandb.log()`](../../../guides/track/log/intro.md), by default set to the last value logged

To view the a run's overview page:
1. Within your project workspace, click on a specific run.
2. Next, click on the **Overview** tab on the left hand column.

<!-- The Python details are private, even if you make the page itself public. Here is an example of my run page in incognito on the left and my account on the right.

### Run states
The proceeding table describes the possible states a run can be in: 

| State | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Finished| Run ended and fully synced data, or called `wandb.finish()` |
| Failed | Run ended with a non-zero exit status | 
| Crashed | Run stopped sending heartbeats in the internal process, which can happen if the machine crashes | 
| Running | Run is still running and has recently sent a heartbeat  |

## Workspace Tab
Use the Workspace tab to view, search, group and arrange visualizations such as:

* Autogenerated plots such as examples predictions made by a validation set
* Custom plots
* System metrics and more

Create charts manually with the W&B App UI or programmatically with the W&B Python SDK. See [Log media and objects in Experiments](../../track/log/intro.md) for more information.

## System Tab

* Visualize CPU utilization, system memory, disk I/O, network traffic, GPU utilization, GPU temperature, GPU time spent accessing memory, GPU memory allocated, and GPU power usage
* Lambda Labs highlighted how to use W&B system metrics in a[ blog post](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/weights-and-bias-gpu-cpu-utilization/)

## Model Tab

* See the layers of your model, the number of parameters, and the output shape of each layer

## Logs Tab

* Output printed on the command line, the stdout and stderr from the machine training the model
* We show the last 10,000 lines. After the run has finished, if you'd like to download the full log file, click the download button in the upper right corner.

## Files Tab

* Save files to sync with the run using [`wandb.save()`](../../track/save-restore.md)
* Keep model checkpoints, validation set examples, and more
* Use the `diff.patch` to [restore](../../track/save-restore.md) the exact version of your code

:::info
The W&B [Artifacts](../../artifacts/intro.md) system adds extra features for handling, versioning, and deduplicating large files like datasets and models. We recommend you use Artifacts for tracking inputs and outputs of runs, rather than `wandb.save`. Check out the Artifacts quickstart [here](../../artifacts/artifacts-walkthrough.md).

## Artifacts Tab

* Provides a searchable list of the input and output [Artifacts](../../artifacts/intro.md) for this run
* Click a row to see information about a particular artifact used or produced by this run
* See the reference for the [project](project-page.md)-level [Artifacts Tab](project-page.md#artifacts-tab) for more on navigating and using the artifacts viewers in the web app [View a live example](https://wandb.ai/stacey/artifact\_july\_demo/runs/2cslp2rt/artifacts)
