# Explore and traverse artifact graphs

    <title>Explore direct acyclic W&B Artifact graphs.</title>
</head>

W&B automatically tracks the artifacts a given run logged as well as the artifacts a given run used. These artifacts can include data sets, models, parameters, metrics, and code. You can explore an artifact's lineage to track and manage of the various artifacts produced throughout the machine learning lifecycle.


## Lineage
### Benefits of artifact lineage
Tracking an artifact's lineage has several key benefits:

- Reproducibility: By tracking the lineage of all artifacts, teams can reproduce experiments, models, and results, which is essential for debugging, experimentation, and validating machine learning models.

- Version Control: Artifact lineage involves versioning of artifacts so that changes can be tracked over time. This allows teams to roll back to previous versions of data, code, or models if needed.

- Auditing: Having a detailed history of the artifacts and their transformations enables organizations to comply with regulatory and governance requirements. This is particularly important in industries such as finance and healthcare, where models must be explainable and transparent.

- Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing: Artifact lineage facilitates better collaboration among team members by providing a clear record of what has been tried, what worked, and what didnâ€™t. This helps in avoiding duplication of efforts and accelerates the development process.

### How to find an artifact's lineage
When selecting an artifact in the **Artifacts** tab, you can see your artifact's lineage. This graph view shows a general overview of your pipeline. 

To view an artifact graph:

1. Navigate to your project in the W&B App UI
2. Choose the artifact icon on the left panel.
3. Select **Lineage**.

### Navigating the lineage graph
The lineage graph generates based on the `type` you provide when you create runs and artifacts. 

The artifact or run type you provide is located above its name, withA artifacts represented by blue icons and runs represented by green icons. The input and output of a run or artifact is depicted in the graph with arrows. 

:::info
You can view the type and the name of artifact in both the left sidebar and in the **Lineage** tab.

For a more detailed view, click the arrow on any individual artifact or run to get more information on a particular object.

### Artifact clusters

When a level of the graph has five or more runs or artifacts, a cluster is created. A cluster has a search bar to find specific versions of runs or artifact and an individual node can be pulled from a cluster to continue investigating the lineage of a node inside a cluster. Clicking on a node opens a preview with an overview of the node.

## Traverse a graph programmatically 
You can also navigate a graph usuing the [W&B API]((../../ref/python/public-api/api.md)). 

### Traverse from an artifact

Create an artifact object and provide the name of the project, artifact, and alias of the artifact:

```python
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()

artifact = api.artifact("project/artifact:alias")
```

Use the artifact object's [`logged_by`](../../ref/python/artifact.md#logged_by) and [`used_by`](../../ref/python/artifact.md#used_by) methods to walk the graph from the artifact:

```python
# Walk up and down the graph from an artifact:
producer_run = artifact.logged_by()
consumer_runs = artifact.used_by()
```

### Traverse from a run
Create an artifact object and provide the name of the project, artifact, and alias of the artifact:

```python
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()

run = api.run("entity/project/run_id")
```

Use the [`logged_artifacts`](../../ref/python/public-api/run.md#logged_artifacts) and [`used_artifacts`](../../ref/python/public-api/run.md#used_artifacts) methods to walk the graph from a given run:

```python
# Walk up and down the graph from a run:
logged_artifacts = run.logged_artifacts()
used_artifacts = run.used_artifacts()
```
