## Obtain your license
Talk to your W&B Sales Team to obtain a license. The sales team will provide a URL that you can use to create a local license and deployment. 

The URL will redirect you to a **Get a License for W&B Local** form. Provide the following information:

1. Choose a deployment type from the **Choose Platform** step. 
2. Select the owner of the license or add a new organization in the **Basic Information** step. 
3. Provide a name for the instance in the **Name of Instance** field and optionally provide a description in the **Description** field in the **Get a License** step.
4. Select the **Generate License Key** button.

A page with an overview of your deployment along with licenses associated to the instance will be displayed. 

For information on how to set up your deployment type, see [INSERT].
