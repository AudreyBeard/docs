# BYOB (Secure storage connector)
Bring your own bucket (BYOB) to store artifacts and other sensitive data for Dedicated Cloud deployments or Self-Managed instances. For Dedicated Cloud deployments, data that you store in your bucket is not stored in the W&B managed infrastructure.

Any communication between W&B and your bucket occurs with pre-signed URLs.

:::info
W&B uses a garbage collection process to delete W&B Artifacts. For more information, see [How to enable garbage collection based on how W&B is hosted](../artifacts/delete-artifacts.md).
:::

## Configuration options
There are two ways you can configure your storage bucket: at an Instance level or at a Team level. 

- Instance level: Any user that has relevant permission within your organization can access any runs or files stored in your W&B Server instance.
- Team level:  Storage bucket that only members of a specific team(s) within your organization can access.  Team level storage buckets allow greater data access control and data isolation for teams with highly sensitive data or strict compliance requirements.

You can configure your bucket at both the instance level and separately for one or more teams within your organization.

For example, suppose you have a team called Kappa in your organization. Your organization (and Team Kappa) have an instance level storage bucket they use. Next, you create a team called Omega. When you create Team Omega, you configure a Team level storage bucket for that team. Files generated by team Omega are not accessible by Team Kappa. However, files created by Team Kappa are accessible by Team Omega. If you want to isolate data for Team Kappa, you will need to configure a Team level storage bucket for that Team Kappa as well.

:::tip
Team level storage bucket provides the same benefits for Self-Managed instances, especially when different business units and departments share an instance to efficiently utilize the infrastructure and administrative resources. This also applies to firms that have separate project teams managing ML workflows for separate customer engagements.

## Availability matrix
The following table shows the availability of different kinds of secure storage connector across different W&B Server deployment types. An `X` means the feature is available on the specific deployment type.

| W&B Server deployment type | Instance level | Team level | Additional information |
|----------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Dedicated Cloud | X | X | Both the instance and team level BYOB are available for Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Only instance level BYOB is available for Azure cloud. |
| SaaS Cloud | | X | The team level BYOB is available only for Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. W&B fully manages the default and only storage bucket for Azure cloud. |
| Self-managed | X | X | Instance level BYOB is the default since the deployment is fully managed by you. It is also possible to use a S3-compatible secure storage solution like [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio). |



## Configure your storage object

W&B recommends that you use a Terraform module managed by W&B for [AWS](https://github.com/wandb/terraform-aws-wandb/tree/main/modules/secure_storage_connector) or [GCP](https://github.com/wandb/terraform-google-wandb/tree/main/modules/secure_storage_connector) to provision a bucket.



:::info
Only system administrators have the permissions to configure an storage object.

A cloud storage bucket can be configured once for a team when you create that team. The same cloud storage bucket can be used amongst multiple teams by selecting an existing cloud storage bucket from the dropdown. 

1. Provide a name for your team in the **Team Name** field. 
2. Choose the Company or Organization you want this team to belong to from the **Company/Organization** dropdown.  
3. Select **External Storage** for the **Choose storage type** option. 
4. Choose either **New bucket** from the dropdown or select an existing bucket. 
5. From the **Cloud provider** dropdown, select your cloud provider.
6. Provide the name of your storage object for the **Name** field.
7. (Optional if you use AWS) Provide the ARN of your encryption key for the **KMS key ARN** field. 
7. Select the **Create Team** button.

An error or warning will appear at the bottom of the page if there are issues accessing the bucket or the bucket has invalid settings.
