# Weights & Biases

![](../images/general/diagram_2021.png)

Weights & Biases is the machine learning platform for developers to build better models faster. Use W&B's lightweight, interoperable tools to quickly track experiments, version and iterate on datasets, evaluate model performance, reproduce models, visualize results and spot regressions, and share findings with colleagues.
Set up W&B in 5 minutes, then quickly iterate on your machine learning pipeline with the confidence that your datasets and models are tracked and versioned in a reliable system of record.
