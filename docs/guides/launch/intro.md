Use W&B Launch to start jobs in your compute  environment or infrastructure of choice from one central interface. W&B Launch removes the complexity of using different environments to run training, inference, and more. Weights and biases will automatically capture the information needed to reproduce the run, containerize the job and launch the job locally or remotely.
