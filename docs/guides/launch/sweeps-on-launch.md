# Sweeps on Launch
Create a hyperparameter tuning job ([sweeps](../sweeps/intro.md)) with W&B Launch. With sweeps on launch, a sweep scheduler is pushed to a Launch Queue with the specified hyperparameters to sweep over. The sweep schedular starts as it is picked up by the agent, launching sweep runs onto the same queue with chosen hyperparameters. This continues until the sweep finishes or is stopped. 

You can use the default W&B Sweep scheduling engine or implement your own custom scheduler:

1. Standard sweep schedular: Use the default W&B Sweep scheduling engine that controls [W&B Sweeps](../sweeps/intro.md). The familiar `bayes`, `grid`, and `random` methods are available.
2. Custom sweep schedular: Configure the sweep scheduler to run as a job. This option enables full customization. An example of how to extend the standard sweep scheduler to include more logging can be found below in the "advanced" section.

:::note
This guide assumes that W&B Launch has been previously configured. If W&B Launch has is not configured, see the [how to get started](./intro.md#how-to-get-started) section of the launch documentation. 
:::

:::tip
We recommend you create a sweep on launch using the 'basic' method if you are a first time users of sweeps on launch. Use a custom sweeps on launch when the standard W&B scheduling engine does not meet your needs.
:::

## Create a sweep with a W&B standard schedular
Create W&B Sweeps with Launch. You can create a sweep interactively with the W&B App or programmatically with the W&B CLI. For advanced configurations of Launch sweeps, including the ability to customize the scheduler, use the CLI. 

:::info
Before you create a sweep with W&B Launch, ensure that you create a job first. Inspect that the run you want to create a job from has a code artifact. See the [Create a Job](./create-job.md) page for more information.

  <TabItem value="app">
Create a sweep interactively with the W&B App.

1. Navigate to you W&B project on the W&B App.  
2. Select the sweeps icon on the left panel (broom image). 
3. Next, select the **Create Sweep** button.
4. Toggle the **Use Launch ðŸš€** slider.
5. From the **Job** dropdown menu, select the name of your job and the job version you want to create a sweep from. 
6. Select the queue to add the job to from the **Queue** dropdown menu.
7. Select **Initialize Sweep**.

Programmatically create a W&B Sweep with Launch with the W&B CLI.

1. Create a Sweep configuration
2. Specify the full job name within you sweep configuration
3. Initialize a sweep agent.

:::info
Steps 1 and 3 are the same steps you normally take when you create a W&B Sweep. With the exception that you need to specify the name of the job within your sweep YAML configuration file. 
:::

For example, in the following code snippet, we specify `'wandb/jobs/Hello World 2:latest'` for the job value:

```yaml
# launch-sweep-config.yaml

job: 'wandb/jobs/Hello World 2:latest'
description: sweep examples using launch jobs

method: bayes
metric:
  goal: minimize
  name: loss_metric
parameters:
  learning_rate:
    max: 0.02
    min: 0
    distribution: uniform
  epochs:
    max: 20
    min: 0
    distribution: int_uniform

# Optional scheduler parameters:

# scheduler:
#   num_workers: 1  # concurrent sweep runs
#   docker_image: <base image for the scheduler>
#   resource: <ie. local-container...>
#   resource_args:  # resource arguments passed to runs
#     env: 
#         - WANDB_API_KEY

# Optional Launch Params
# launch: 
#    registry: <registry for image pulling>
```

For information on how to create a sweep configuration, see the [Define sweep configuration](../sweeps/define-sweep-configuration.md) page.

4. Next, initialize a sweep. Provide the path to your config file, the name of your job queue, your W&B entity, and the name of the project.

```bash
wandb launch-sweep <path/to/yaml/file> --queue <queue_name> --entity <your_entity>  --project <project_name>
```

For more information on W&B Sweeps, see the [Tune Hyperparameters](../sweeps/intro.md) chapter.

## Create a custom sweep schedular
Create a custom sweep schedular either with the W&B schedular or a custom schedular.

:::info
Using scheduler jobs requires wandb cli version >= `0.15.4`
:::

<Tabs
  defaultValue="wandb-scheduler"
  values={[
    {label: 'Wandb scheduler', value: 'wandb-scheduler'},
    {label: 'Custom scheduler', value: 'custom-scheduler'},
  ]}>
    <TabItem value="wandb-scheduler">

  Create a launch sweep using the W&B sweep scheduling logic as a job.
  
  1. Identify the 'Wandb Sweep Scheduler' job in the public wandb/jobs project, or use the job name:
  `'wandb/jobs/Wandb Sweep Scheduler:latest'`
  2. Construct a configuration yaml with an additional `scheduler` block that includes a `job` key pointing to this name, example below.
  3. Use the `wandb launch-sweep` command with the new config.


Example config:
```yaml
# launch-sweep-config.yaml  
description: Launch sweep config using a scheduler job
scheduler:
  job: 'wandb/jobs/Wandb Sweep Scheduler:latest'
  num_workers: 8  # allows 8 concurrent sweep runs

# training/tuning job that the sweep runs will execute
job: 'wandb/jobs/Hello World 2:latest'
method: grid
parameters:
  param1:
    min: 0
    max: 10
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="custom-scheduler">

  Custom schedulers can be created by creating a scheduler-job. For the purposes of this guide we will be modifying the `WandbScheduler` to provide more logging. 

  1. Clone the `wandb/launch-jobs` repo (specifically: `wandb/launch-jobs/jobs/sweep_schedulers`)
  2. Now, we can modify the `wandb_scheduler.py` to achieve our desired increased logging. Example: Add logging to the function `_poll`. This is called once every polling cycle (configurable timing), before we launch new sweep runs. 
  3. Run the modified file to create a job, with: `python wandb_scheduler.py --project <project> --entity <entity> --name CustomWandbScheduler`
  4. Identify the name of the job created, either in the UI or in the output of the previous call, which will be a code-artifact job (unless otherwise specified).
  5. Now create a sweep configuration where the scheduler points to your new job!

```yaml
...
scheduler:
  job: '<entity>/<project>/job-CustomWandbScheduler:latest'
...
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

 Examples of what is possible with custom sweep scheduler jobs are available in the [wandb/launch-jobs](https://github.com/wandb/launch-jobs) repo under `jobs/sweep_schedulers`. This guide shows how to use the publicly available **Wandb Scheduler Job**, as well demonstrates a process for creating custom sweep scheduler jobs. 


 ## How to resume sweeps on launch
  It is also possible to resume a launch-sweep from a previously launched sweep. Although hyperparameters and the training job cannot be changed, scheduler-specific parameters can be, as well as the queue it is pushed to.

:::info
If the initial sweep used a training job with an alias like 'latest', resuming can lead to different results if the latest job version has been changed since the last run.
:::

  1. Identify the sweep name/ID for a previously run launch sweep. The sweep ID is an eight character string (for example, `hhd16935`) that you can find in your project on the W&B App.
  2. If you change the scheduler parameters, construct an updated config file.
  3. In your terminal, execute the following command. Replace content wrapped in "<" and ">" with your information: 

```bash
wandb launch-sweep <optional config.yaml> --resume_id <sweep id> --queue <queue_name>
```
