# Document machine learning model

Create a model card for your registered model to document aspects of your machine learning model. Some common topics worth documenting include:

* **Summary**: A summary of what the model; purpose, framework that was used, and so forth. 
* **Training data**: Describe which training data was used. What sort of processing was done on the training data set. Where is that data stored.
* **Architecture**: The architecture of the machine learning algorithm. Did the algorithm use transfer learning? And so forth.
* **Deserialize the model**: Provide information on how someone on your team can load the model into memory.


## Create a model card

1. Navigate to the W&B Model Registry app at [https://wandb.ai/registry/model](https://wandb.ai/registry/model).
2. Select a registered model.
2. Go to the **Model card** section.
3. Within the **Description** field, provide information about your machine learning model. 

You can format text within a model card with [Markdown markup language](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
