# Access control

Use model registry role based access controls (RBAC) to control who can update *protected aliases*. Protected aliases are the aliases you use to represent key stages of your model development pipeline. With RBAC you can:

1. Assign *Model Registry Admins*: Give specific members of your team admin permissions for the model registry. Model registry admins can define and use protected aliases, and non-admins are blocked from adding and removing protected aliases from model versions.
2. Create *Protected Aliases*: Define a list of aliases that only admins can manage. For example, you might use the `production` alias to indicate a model is deployed.



For example, suppose you set `staging` and `production` as protected aliases. Any member of your team can add new model versions. These newly added models are assigned a `latest` alias.  However, only admins can add a `staging` or `production` alias.




## Set up access control
The following steps describe how to set up access controls for your teamâ€™s model registry.
