# Notifications
Get Slack notifications when a new model version is linked to the model registry. 

First, configure your notifications channel for your team.

Next, pick which registered models you want to get notifications about. 

In the example below, the Nature Classification registered model has Slack notifications turned on. A message is automatically posted to the connected Slack channel when a new model version is linked to this registered model.
