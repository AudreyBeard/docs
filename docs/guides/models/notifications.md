1. Select the registered model you want to receive notifications from.
2. Click on the **Connect Slack** button.
3. Configure your notifications channel for your team.

4. Once you have configured Slack notification from your team, you can pick and choose registered models to get notifications from. 

In the example below, the Nature Classification registered model has Slack notifications turned on. A message is automatically posted to the connected Slack channel when a new model version is linked to this registered model.
