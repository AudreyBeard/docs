# LLMs

Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be difficult. Weights and Biases offers several tools to streamline the evaluation process, providing a visual way to analyze your generative models.

## Visualize

[W&B Prompts](/guides/prompts) is a suite of LLMOps tools built for the development of LLM-powered applications. Use W&B Prompts to visualize and inspect the execution flow of your LLMs, analyze the inputs and outputs of your LLMs, view the intermediate results and securely store and manage your prompts and LLM chain configurations.

W&B Prompts provides several solutions for building and monitoring LLM-based apps. Software developers, prompt engineers, ML practitioners, data scientists, and other stakeholders working with LLMs need cutting-edge tools to:

- Explore and debug LLM chainsÂ and prompts with greater granularity.
- Monitor and observe LLMs to better understand and evaluate performance, usage, and budgets.

## Monitor

[LLM Monitoring](/guides/weave/prod-mon) provides large language model usage monitoring and diagnostics. Start simply, then customize and evolve your monitoring analytics over time.

- Organizations can track and manage prompts usage statistics like cost across teams
- Individuals can filter and drill down to analyze prompt performance, observe all inputs sent to the prompt and track custom metrics to use for analysis
- (Coming soon) Use this monitored data to improve your pipeline by providing feedback and fine-tuning or evaluating with it.

## Integrations

Weights and Biases also has lightweight integrations for:

- [LangChain](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/langchain)
- [OpenAI API](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/openai-api)
- [OpenAI GPT-3.5 Fine-Tuning](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/openai)
- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/huggingface)

## Next Steps

- Check out more detailed documentation on [Prompts](/guides/prompts) or [LLM Monitoring](/guides/weave/prod-mon).
- Learn more about [Weave](/guides/weave), our visual development environment that has many LLMOps tools built in.
