# Registry types

W&B supports two types of registries: Core registries and Custom registries. 

* Core registry: Core registries are integrated into the registries platform automatically. There are two types of core registries: models and datasets.
* Custom registry: Custom registries provide greater flexibility and customization to meet specific requirements. 


The proceeding table summarizes the differences between core and custom registries:

|                | Core  | Custom|
| -------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Metadata       | Preconfigured and not editable by users. | Users can edit.  |
| Artifact types | Preconfigured artifact types that cannot be removed. Users can add additional types. | Fully customizable by users.|
| Visibility     | Set to "organization" and cannot be altered. | Can be altered from "organization" to "restricted".|
| Flexibility    | Limited to adding additional types to the existing list, ensuring core functionality remains standardized.| High flexibility, allowing users to customize names, descriptions, accepted artifact types and visibility.|
| Use case       | Template for specific use cases with a standardized setup to maintain core functionality.|  Offers greater flexibility and customization to meet specific user requirements. |
