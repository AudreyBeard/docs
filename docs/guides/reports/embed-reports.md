# Embed reports

### HTML iframe element

Select the **Share** button on the upper right hand corner within a report. A modal window will appear. Within the modal window, select **Copy embed code**. The copied code will render within an Inline Frame (IFrame)  HTML element. Paste the copied code into an iframe HTML element of your choice.

_Note: Only **public** reports are viewable when embedded currently._
