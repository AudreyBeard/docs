# Runs

A single unit of computation logged by W&B is called a *run*. You can think of a W&B run as an atomic element of your whole project. You should create and initiate a new run if you:

* Train a model
* Change a hyperparameter
* Use a different model
* Log data or a model as a [W&B Artifact](../artifacts/intro.md)
* [Download a W&B Artifact](../artifacts/download-and-use-an-artifact.md)

For example, during a [Sweep](../sweeps/intro.md) W&B explores a hyperparameter search and explores the space of possible models. Each new hyperparameter combination is implemented as a new W&B run. 


:::tip
Some key things to consider when you create and manage runs:
* Anything you log with `wandb.log` is recorded in that run.  For more information on how log objects in W&B, see [Log Media and Objects](../track/log/intro.md). 
* Each run is associated to a specific W&B project.
* View runs and their properties within the run's project workspace on the W&B App UI.
* There is only at most one active [`wandb.Run`](../../ref/python/run.md) in any process,
and it is accessible as `wandb.run`.
:::

## Create a run

Create a W&B run with [`wandb.init()`](../../ref/python/init.md):

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init()
```

We recommend you specify a project name and a W&B entity when you create a new run. W&B creates a new project (if the project does not already exist) within the W&B entity you provide. If the project already exists, W&B will store the run in that project.

For example, the following code snippet initializes a run that is stored in a project called `model_registry_example` that is scoped within a `wandbee` entity:

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init(entity="wandbee", project="model_registry_example")
```

:::info
W&B stores runs in a project called "Uncategorized" if a project is not specified.
:::

W&B will print the name of the run that was created along with a URL path to find out more information about that specific run. The URL path has the form `https://wandb.ai/entity/project-name/run-id`. 

For example, the code snippet above produced this output:


![](/images/runs/run_example.png)


Since we did not specify a name for the run, a random name generated for it by W&B called `likely-lion-9`. The run is stored in a project called `model_registry_example`. And it was given a *run ID* of `xlm66ixq`.


:::note
Run names that are randomly generated by W&B are not guaranteed to be unique.
:::

You can optionally provide a unique run ID identifier with the `id` parameter and a name for your run when you initialize a run with `wandb.init`.  For example, 

```python 
import wandb

run = wandb.init(
  entity="entity", 
  project="awesome-project", 
  name="", 
  id=""
  )
```

For a full list of parameters you can use, see the [`wandb.init`](../../ref/python/init.md) reference documentation. 

## View a run

View a specific run within the project the run was logged to:

1. Navigate to the W&B App UI at [https://wandb.ai/home](https://wandb.ai/home).
2. Navigate to the W&B project you specified when you initialized the run.
3. Within your project's workspace, you will see a table labeled **Runs**. This table lists all the runs that are in your project. From the list of runs shown, select the run you want to view.
  ![Example project workspace called 'sweep-demo'](/images/app_ui/workspace_tab_example.png)
4. Next, select the **Overview Tab** icon. 

The following image demonstrates information about a Run called **sparkling-glade-2**:

![W&B Dashboard run overview tab](/images/app_ui/wandb_run_overview_page.png)

The **Overview Tab** shows the following information about the run you selected:

* **Run name**: The name of the run.
* **Description**: A description of the run that you provided. This field is left initially blank if no description was specified when you create the run. You can optionally provide a description for the run with the W&B App UI or programmatically. 
* **Privacy**: Privacy settings of the run. You can set it to either **Private** or **Public**. 
    * **Private**: (Default) Only you can view and contribute.
    * **Public**: Anyone can view.
* **Tags**: (list, optional) A list of strings. Tags are useful for organizing runs together, or applying temporary labels like "baseline" or "production".
* **Author**: The W&B username that created the run.
* **Run state**: The state of the run:
  * **finished**: script ended and fully synced data, or called `wandb.finish()`
  * **failed**: script ended with a non-zero exit status
  * **crashed**: script stopped sending heartbeats in the internal process, which can happen if the machine crashes
  * **running**: script is still running and has recently sent a heartbeat
* **Start time**: The timestamp when the run started.
* **Duration**: How long, in seconds, the run took to **finish**, **fail**, or **crash**.
* **Run path**: The unique run identifier. It has the form of `entity/project/run-ID`
* **Host name**: Where the run was launched. The name of your machine is displayed if you launched the run locally on your machine. 
* **Operating system**: The operating system used for the run.
* **Python version**: The Python version used for the run.
* **Python executable**: The command that started the run.
* **System Hardware**: The hardware used to create the run. 
* **W&B CLI version**: The W&B ClI version installed on the machine that hosted the run command.
* **Job Type**:

<!-- :::info
The Python details are private, even if you make the page itself public. 
::: -->


Below the overview section, you will additionally find information about: 

* **Artifact Outputs**: Artifact outputs produced by the run.
* **Config**: List of config parameters saved with [`wandb.config`](../../guides/track/config.md).
* **Summary**: List of summary parameters saved with [`wandb.log()`](../../guides/track/log/intro.md). By default, this value is set to the last value logged.



For more information about how to organize multiple Runs in a project, see the [Runs Table](../app/features/runs-table.md) documentation. 

For a live example of a Project's Workspace, [see this example project](https://app.wandb.ai/example-team/sweep-demo). 

## End a run
W&B automatically calls [`wandb.finish`](../../ref/python/finish.md) to finalize and cleanup a run. However, if you call [`wandb.init`](../../ref/python/init.md) from a child process, you must explicitly call `wandb.finish` at the end of the child process. 

:::note
The wandb.finish API is automatically called when your script exits.
:::

You can end a run manually with the [`wandb.finish`](../../ref/python/finish.md) API or end a Run using a `with` statement. The following code example demonstrates how to end a run from a `with` Python statement:

```python
import wandb

wandb.init()
wandb.finish()

assert wandb.run is None

with wandb.init() as run:
    pass  # log data here

assert wandb.run is None
```







<!-- ### Search runs

Search for a specific run by name in the sidebar. You can use regex to filter down your visible runs. The search box affects which runs are shown on the graph. Here's an example:
