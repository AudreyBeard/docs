# Runs

A single unit of computation logged by W&B is called a *run*. You can think of a W&B run as an atomic element of your whole project. You should create and initiate a new run if you:

* Each time you train a model.
* Change a hyperparameter
* Use a different model
* Log data or a model as a [W&B Artifact](../artifacts/intro.md).
* [Download a W&B Artifact](../artifacts/download-and-use-an-artifact.md).

For example, during a [Sweep](../sweeps/intro.md) W&B explores a hyperparameter search and explores the space of possible models. Each new hyperparameter combination is implemented as a new W&B run. 


:::tip
Some key things to consider when you create and manage runs:
* Anything you log with `wandb.log` is recorded in that run.  For more information on how log objects in W&B, see [Log Media and Objects](../track/log/intro.md). 
* Each run is associated to a specific W&B project.
* View runs and their properties within the run's project workspace[LINK] on the W&B App UI.
:::

## Create a run

Create a W&B run with [`wandb.init()`](../../ref/python/init.md):

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init()
```

We recommend you specify a project name and a W&B entity when you create a new run. W&B creates a new project (if the project does not already exist) within the W&B entity you provide. If the project already exists, W&B will store the run in that project.

For example, the following code snippet initializes a run that is stored in a project called `awesome project` that is scoped with a `wandbee` entity:

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init(entity="wandbee", project="awesome project")
```

:::info
W&B stores runs in a project called "Uncategorized" if a project is not specified.
:::


W&B will print the name of the run that was created along with a URL path to find out more information about that specific run. For example,

[image of run]

In the above example, W&B created a run with the random name `likely-lion-9`. By default, the name of the run is randomly generated for you. You can specify a specific name for your run with the `name` parameter in `wandb.init`.



:::note
Run names that are randomly generated by W&B are not guaranteed to be unique.
:::

You can optionally provide a unique identifier to a run with the `id` parameter when you initialize a run with `wandb.init`.  For example, 

```python 
import wandb

run = wandb.init(
  entity="entity", 
  project="awesome-project", 
  name="", 
  id=""
  )
```

For a full list of parameters you can use, see the `wandb.init`[LINK] reference documentation. 

<!-- There is only ever at most one active [`wandb.Run`](../../ref/python/run.md) in any process,
and it is accessible as `wandb.run`:

```python
import wandb

assert wandb.run is None

wandb.init()

assert wandb.run is not None
```


You need to finish a run that has not completed in order to start one or more Runs in the same notebook or script. 
 -->

## View a run

Use the run page to explore detailed information about a specific run. 

1. Navigate to the W&B App UI [LINK].
2. Navigate to your W&B project.
3. Select a run from the **Runs Sidebar**.
2. Next, select the **Overview Tab** icon. 

The following image demonstrates information about a Run called "sparkling-glade-2":

![W&B Dashboard run overview tab](/images/app_ui/wandb_run_overview_page.png)

The **Overview Tab** shows the following information about the run you selected:

* **Run name**: The name of the run.
* **Description**: A description of the run that you provided. This field is left initially blank if no description was specified when you create the run. You can optionally provide a description for the run with the W&B App UI or programmatically. 
* **Privacy**: Privacy settings of the run. You can set it to either **Private** or **Public**. 
    * **Private**: (Default) Only you can view and contribute.
    * **Public**: Anyone can view.
* **Tags**: (list, optional) A list of strings. Tags are useful for organizing runs together, or applying temporary labels like "baseline" or "production".
* **Author**: The W&B username that created the run.
* **Run state**: The state of the run:
  * **finished**: script ended and fully synced data, or called `wandb.finish()`
  * **failed**: script ended with a non-zero exit status
  * **crashed**: script stopped sending heartbeats in the internal process, which can happen if the machine crashes
  * **running**: script is still running and has recently sent a heartbeat
* **Start time**: The timestamp when the run started.
* **Duration**: How long, in seconds, the run took to **finish**, **fail**, or **crash**.
* **Run path**: The unique run identifier. It has the form of `entity/project/run-ID`
* **Host name**: Where the run was launched. The name of your machine is displayed if you launched the run locally on your machine. 
* **Operating system**: The operating system used for the run.
* **Python version**: The Python version used for the run.
* **Python executable**: The command that started the run.
* **System Hardware**: The hardware used to create the run. 
* **W&B CLI version**: The W&B ClI version installed on the machine that hosted the run command.
* **Job Type**:

<!-- :::info
The Python details are private, even if you make the page itself public. 
::: -->


Below the overview section, you will additionally find information about: 

* **Artifact Outputs**: Artifact outputs produced by the run.
* **Config**: List of config parameters saved with [`wandb.config`](../../guides/track/config.md).
* **Summary**: List of summary parameters saved with [`wandb.log()`](../../guides/track/log/intro.md). By default, this value is set to the last value logged.



## End a run
W&B automatically calls [`wandb.finish`](../../ref/python/finish.md) to finalize and cleanup a run. However, if you call [`wandb.init`](../../ref/python/init.md) from a child process, you must explicitly call `wandb.finish` at the end of the child process. 

:::note
The wandb.finish API is automatically called when your script exits.
:::

You can end a run manually with the [`wandb.finish`](../../ref/python/finish.md) API or end a Run using a `with` statement. The following code example demonstrates how to end a run from a `with` Python statement:

```python
import wandb

wandb.init()
wandb.finish()

assert wandb.run is None

with wandb.init() as run:
    pass  # log data here

assert wandb.run is None
```



## View runs within a project
View runs associated to a project with the W&B App UI. Navigate to the W&B App and search for the name of your project. 

In the following example we search for a project called "my-first-run":

![](/images/runs/search_run_name_landing_page.png)

Select the project. This will redirect you to that project's Workspace. A Project's Workspace gives you a personal sandbox to compare runs. Use projects to organize models that can be compared, working on the same problem with different architectures, hyperparameters, datasets, preprocessing and so on.

Within your project's workspace, you will see a table labeled **Runs**. This table lists all the Runs that are in your project. In other words, these runs were provided a `project` argument when it was created.

The following image demonstrates a project workspace called "sweep-demo":

![Example project workspace called 'sweep-demo'](/images/app_ui/workspace_tab_example.png)

The **Runs Sidebar** lists of all the runs in your project. Hover your mouse over a single Run to modify or view the following:

* **Kebob menu**: Use this kebob menu to rename a Run, delete a Run, or stop an active Run.
* **Visibility icon**: Select the eye icon to hide specific run.
* **Color**: change the run color to another one of our presets or a custom color.
* **Search**: search runs by name. This also filters visible runs in the plots.
* **Filter**: use the sidebar filter to narrow down the set of runs visible.
* **Group**: select a config column to dynamically group your runs, for example by architecture. Grouping makes plots show up with a line along the mean value, and a shaded region for the variance of points on the graph.
* **Sort**: pick a value to sort your runs by, for example runs with the lowest loss or highest accuracy. Sorting will affect which runs show up on the graphs.
* **Expand button**: expand the sidebar into the full table
* **Run count**: the number in parentheses at the top is the total number of runs in the project. The number (N visualized) is the number of runs that have the eye turned on and are available to be visualized in each plot. In the example below, the graphs are only showing the first 10 of 183 runs. Edit a graph to increase the max number of runs visible.

For more information about how to organize multiple Runs in a project, see the [Runs Table](../app/features/runs-table.md) documentation. 

For a live example of a Project's Workspace, [see this example project](https://app.wandb.ai/example-team/sweep-demo). 



<!-- ### Search runs

Search for a specific run by name in the sidebar. You can use regex to filter down your visible runs. The search box affects which runs are shown on the graph. Here's an example:
