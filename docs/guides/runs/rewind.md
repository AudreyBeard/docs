# Rewind Runs
:::caution
The ability to rewind a run is in private preview. Contact W&B Support at support@wandb.com to request access to this feature.
:::

Use `resume_from` with [`wandb.init()`](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/init) to "rewind" a runâ€™s history to a specific step. When you rewind a run, W&B resets the state of the run to the specified step, preserving the original data and maintaining a consistent run ID. This feature allows for correction or modification of the run history without losing the original data, and enables new data logging from that point. Summary metrics are recomputed based on the newly logged history.

:::info
Rewinding a run requires monotonically increasing steps. You can not use non-monotonic steps defined with [`define_metric()`](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/run#define_metric) to set a fork point because it would disrupt the essential chronological order of run history and system metrics.
:::

:::info
Rewinding a run requires the [`wandb`](https://pypi.org/project/wandb/) SDK version >= 0.17.1.

### History and Config Management

- **History truncation**: The history is truncated to the rewind point, allowing new data logging.
- **Summary metrics**: Recomputed based on the newly logged history.
- **Configuration preservation**: Original configurations are preserved and can be merged with new configurations.

### Run Management

- **Run archiving**: Original runs are archived and accessible from the [**`Run Overview`**](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/app/pages/run-page#overview-tab).
- **Artifact inheritance**: New runs inherit artifacts from the original run.
- **Artifact association**: Artifacts are associated with the latest version of the rewound run.
- **Immutable run IDs**: Introduced for consistent rewinding from a precise state.
- **Copy immutable run ID**: A button to copy the immutable run ID for improved run management.

### Rewind and Forking Integration

Rewind complements the Forking feature by providing more flexibility in managing and experimenting with your runs. While Forking allows you to create a new branch off a run at a specific point to try different parameters or models, Rewinding a run allows you to correct or modify the run history itself.

### Rewind a Run

To rewind a run, use the `resume_from` argument in `wandb.init()` and specify the run name and the step from which you want to rewind:

```python
import wandb

# Initialize and log some data
run = wandb.init(project="your_project_name", entity="your_entity_name")
for i in range(1000):
    run.log({"metric": i**2})
run.finish()

# Rewind the run to step 500
rewind_run = wandb.init(
    project="your_project_name",
    entity="your_entity_name",
    resume_from="your_run_name",
    step=500
)

# Log new data from step 500 onwards
for i in range(500, 1000):
    rewind_run.log({"metric": i*2})
rewind_run.finish()
```
### Fork from a Rewound Run

To fork from a rewound run, use the `fork_from` argument in `wandb.init()` and specify the source run ID and the step from the source run to fork from:

```python 
import wandb

# Fork the run from a specific step
forked_run = wandb.init(
    project="your_project_name",
    entity="your_entity_name",
    fork_from=f"{rewind_run.id}?_step=500",
)

# Continue logging in the new run
for i in range(500, 1000):
    forked_run.log({"metric": i*3})
forked_run.finish()
```

### Unsupported Functionality
- **Log rewind**: Logs are reset in the new run segment.
- **System metrics rewind**: Only new system metrics after the rewind point are logged.
- **Artifact association with specific run segments**: Artifacts are associated with the latest run segment, not the segment that produced them.
