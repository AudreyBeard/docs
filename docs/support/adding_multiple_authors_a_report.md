When multiple users work on a report together, they should be credited as such. In our reports, you can do just that and add all the users that worked together on a report in the Author line. This is done by clicking Edit on the top right of the page. From there, a '+' will be seen on the right of the author line to where you can add all of the team members that have contributed to the report.
