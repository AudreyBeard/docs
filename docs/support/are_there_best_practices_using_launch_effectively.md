1. Create your queue before you start your agent, so that you can set your agent to point to it easily.  If you donâ€™t do this, your agent will give errors and not work until you add a queue.
  2. Create a W&B service account to start up the agent, so that it's not tied to an individual user account.
  3. Use `wandb.config` to read and write your hyperparameters, so that they can be overwritten when re-running a job. Check out [this guide](/guides/track/config/#set-the-configuration-with-argparse) if you use argsparse.
