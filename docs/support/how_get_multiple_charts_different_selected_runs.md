>>>>>>> 6ef6c45f4d73f19772f9c0cbb4fbccb2cee243c2
With wandb reports the procedure is as follows:

* Have multiple panel grids.
* Add filters to filter the run sets of each panel grid. This will help in selecting the runs that you want to portray in the respective panels.
* Create the charts you want in the panel grids.
