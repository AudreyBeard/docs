### How is access to the API controlled?
>>>>>>> 6ef6c45f4d73f19772f9c0cbb4fbccb2cee243c2
For simplicity, W&B uses API keys for authorization when accessing the API. You can find your API keys in your [settings](https://app.wandb.ai/settings). Your API key should be stored securely and never checked into version control. In addition to personal API keys, you can add Service Account users to your team.
