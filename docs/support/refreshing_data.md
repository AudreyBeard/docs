Reload the page to refresh data in a report and get the latest results from your active runs. Workspaces automatically load fresh data if you have the **Auto-refresh** option active (available in the dropdown menu in the upper right corner of your page). Auto-refresh does not apply to reports, so this data will not refresh until you reload the page.
