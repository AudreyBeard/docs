### What is the difference between team and entity? As a user - what does entity mean for me?
A team is a collaborative workspace for a group of users working on the same projects, while an entity refers to either a username or a team name. When you log runs in W&B, you can set the entity to your personal account or a team account `wandb.init(entity="example-team")`.
