**What's changed in the new reports release?**

Reports maintain the same appearance in view mode and can include identical content as before, but editing now uses a WYSIWYG interface.

**What is WYSIWYG?**

WYSIWYG stands for What You See Is What You Get. It describes an editor where the content appears the same during editing and presentation. Previously, W&B reports relied on Markdown editors, requiring shifts to preview mode to view final output. W&B reports now operate entirely in WYSIWYG mode.

**Why change to WYSIWYG?**

Users reported that switching between Markdown mode and preview mode disrupted their workflow. Eliminating Markdown editing streamlines the process of sharing research. The new interface enables intuitive actions, including arbitrary reordering, cut and paste, and undo history for all elements, enhancing report creation. Additionally, WYSIWYG facilitates the introduction of future advanced features, such as video embeds, text selection commenting, and real-time collaboration.

**My report looks different after converting from Markdown.**

The goal is to maintain the original appearance after transitioning to WYSIWYG, but the conversion process is not flawless. If significant discrepancies arise, report them for evaluation. Users can revert to the previous state until the editing session concludes.

**I prefer Markdown. Can I still use it?**

Yes. Type "/mark" anywhere in the document and press enter to insert a Markdown block. This allows editing with Markdown as before.

**My report is running slowly now.**

Performance issues may arise on older hardware or with very large reports. To mitigate this, collapse sections of the report that are not currently in use.

**How do I delete a panel grid?**

Select the panel grid and press delete or backspace. Click the drag handle in the top-right corner to easily select the panel grid.

**How do I insert a table?**

Tables remain the only feature from Markdown without a direct WYSIWYG equivalent. To add a table, insert a Markdown block and create the table inside it.

**I converted my report to WYSIWYG but want to revert back to Markdown.**

If the report conversion occurred through the message at the top, click the red "Revert" button to restore the prior state. Note that any changes made after conversion will be lost.

If a single Markdown block was converted, use cmd+z to undo.

If options to revert are unavailable because of a closed session, consider discarding the draft or editing from the last saved version. If neither works, contact support through the Intercom bubble, and the team can assist in restoring the last working state.

**I have a problem that isn't addressed by this FAQ.**

Reach out via the Intercom bubble at the bottom right of the page, including a report link and the keyword "WYSIWYG." If the Intercom widget is not visible, it could be blocked by browser extensions. In that case, contact support at contact@wandb.com.
