# Spin up a single node GPU cluster with Minikube

Setup W&B Launch on a Minikube cluster that can schedule and run GPU workloads.

## Background

If you are using Docker queues for workloads running on a single host, there is a compelling reason to use a Kubernetes queue with an agent connected to a local Kubernetes cluster instead: GPU scheduling. Docker queues control how the job is run through `docker run` arguments, which only allow requesting specific GPU on the host or `all` which severely limits the efficiency of parallel workloads. Kubernetes allows you to specify a number of desired GPU and then takes care of the scheduling.

The [Nvidia container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/index.html) has made it easy to run GPU-enabled workflows on Docker, but setting up a local Kubernetes cluster with GPU scheduling can take considerable time and effort, until recently. Minikube, one of the most popular tools for running single node Kubernetes clusters, recently released [support for GPU scheduling](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/nvidia/) ðŸŽ‰Â making it very straightforward to spin up a single node Kubernetes cluster with multiple GPU- precisely what we will do in this tutorial.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you will need:

1. A Weights & Biases account.
2. Linux machine with the following installed and running:
   1. Docker runtime
   2. Drivers for any GPU you want to use
   3. Nvidia container toolkit

When creating this tutorial, we used an `n1-standard-16` Google Cloud Compute Engine instance with 4 Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU connected. If you are running in the cloud, consider using a Kubernetes cluster directly. This tutorial is intended to guide users with direct access GPU, i.e. not renting by the hour.

## Create a queue for our jobs

## Setup Docker + Nvidia CTK

If you already have Docker and the Nvidia container toolkit setup on your machine, you can skip this section.

Refer to [Dockerâ€™s documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for instructions on setting up the Docker container engine on your system.

Once you have Docker installed, install the Nvidia container toolkit [following the instructions in Nvidiaâ€™s documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

To validate that your container runtime has access to your GPU, you can run:

```bash
docker run --gpus all ubuntu nvidia-smi
```

You should see `nvidia-smi` output describing the GPU connected to your machine. For example, on our setup the output looks like this:

## Setup Minikube

Minikubeâ€™s GPU support requires version `v1.32.0-beta0` or later. Refer to [Minikubeâ€™s install documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) for up to date installation help. For this tutorial, we installed the latest Minikube release using the command:

```yaml
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

The next step is to start a minikube cluster using your GPU. On your machine, run:

```yaml
minikube start --gpus all
```

The output of the command above will indicate whether a cluster has been successfully created.

## Start launch agent

The launch agent for your new cluster can either be started by invoking `wandb launch-agent` directly or by deploying the launch agent using our [helm chart](https://github.com/wandb/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/launch-agent). In this tutorial we will run the agent directly on our host machine for the sake of simplicity. Running the agent outside of a container also means we can use the local Docker host to build images for our cluster to run.

To run the agent locally, make sure your default Kubernetes API context refers to the Minikube cluster. Then, run

```
pip install wandb[launch]
```

to install the agentâ€™s dependencies. To setup authentication for the agent, run `wandb login` or set the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable.

To start the agent, run

```
wandb launch-agent -j <max-number-concurrent-jobs> -q <queue-name> -e <queue-entity>
```

You should the launch agent start to print its polling message. Congratulations, you have a running launch agent! Now, when a job is added to your queue, your agent will pick it up and schedule it to run on your Minikube cluster.

## Launch a job

Now, time to send a job to our agent. You can launch a simple hello world from a terminal logged into your W&B account with:

```yaml
wandb launch -d wandb/job_hello_world:main -p <target-wandb-project> -q <your-queue-name> -e <your-queue-entity>
```

You can test with any job or image you like, but do make sure your cluster can pull your image. Please refer to [Minikubeâ€™s documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/registry/) for additional guidance. You can also [test using one of our public jobs](https://wandb.ai/wandb/jobs/jobs?workspace=user-bcanfieldsherman).

## (Optional) Model and data caching with NFS

For ML workloads we will often want multiple jobs to have access to the same data. For example, you may want to have a shared cache to avoid repeatedly downloading large assets like datasets or model weights. Kubernetes supports this through [persistent volumes and persistent volume claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/). These can be used to create `volumeMounts` in our Kubernetes workloads, providing direct filesystem access to the shared cache.

In this step, we will set up a network file system (NFS) server that can be used as a shared cache for model weights. The first step is to install and configure NFS. This process varies by operating system. Since our VM is running Ubuntu, we installed nfs-kernel-server and configured an export at `/srv/nfs/kubedata`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
sudo mkdir -p /srv/nfs/kubedata
sudo chown nobody:nogroup /srv/nfs/kubedata
sudo sh -c 'echo "/srv/nfs/kubedata *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash,no_all_squash,insecure)" >> /etc/exports'
sudo exportfs -ra
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
```

However you start your NFS sever, keep note of the export location of the server in your host filesystem, as well as the local IP address of your NFS server, i.e. your host machine. We will need this pieces of information in the next step.

Next, you will need to create a persistent volume and persistent volume claim for this NFS. Persistent volumes are highly customizable, but we will use straightforward configuration here for the sake of simplicity.

Copy the yaml below into a file named `nfs-persistent-volume.yaml` , making sure to fill out your desired volume capacity and claim request. The `[PersistentVolume.spec.capcity.storage](http://PersistentVolume.spec.capcity.storage)` field controls the maximum size of the underlying volume. The `PersistentVolumeClaim.spec.resources.requests.stroage` can be used to limit the volume capacity allotted for a particular claim. For our use case, it makes sense to use the same value for each.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: nfs-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 100Gi # Set this to your desired capacity.
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  nfs:
    server: <your-nfs-server-ip> # TODO: Fill this in.
    path: '/srv/nfs/kubedata' # Or your custom path
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: nfs-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Gi # Set this to your desired capacity.
  storageClassName: ''
  volumeName: nfs-pv
```

Create the resources in your cluster with:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f nfs-persistent-volume.yaml
```

In order for our runs to make use of this cache, we will need to add `volumes` and `volumeMounts` to our launch queue config. To edit the launch config, head back to [wandb.ai/launch](http://wandb.ai/launch) (or \<your-wandb-url\>/launch for users on wandb server), find your queue, click to the queue page, and then click the **Edit config** tab. The original config can be modified to:

                "memory": "12Gi",
                "nvidia.com/gpu": 1
              },
              "volumeMounts": [
                {
                  "name": "nfs-storage",
                  "mountPath": "/root/.cache"
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        ],
        "restartPolicy": "Never",
        "volumes": [
          {
            "name": "nfs-storage",
            "persistentVolumeClaim": {
              "claimName": "nfs-pvc"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "backoffLimit": 0
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Now, our NFS will be mounted at `/root/.cache` in the containers running our jobs. The mount path will require adjustment if your container runs as a user other than `root`. Huggingfaceâ€™s libraries and W&B Artifacts both make use of `$HOME/.cache/` by default, so downloads should only happen once.

## Playing with stable diffusion

To test out our new system, we are going to experiment with stable diffusionâ€™s inference parameters.
